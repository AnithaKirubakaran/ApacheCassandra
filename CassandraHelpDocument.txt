Apache Cassandra:(combination of BigData nd DynamoDB)

Apache Cassandra is an example of NoSQL Database.
NoSQL database is Non-relational database
It is a column-oriented database.
stores the data in the form of key value pairs
No master slave concept (masterless replication) it will be like cassandra cluster rings

Node concept (not a centralized node)
create replication - configure the nodes (can define nodes to store the data)

support collections

Cassandra Tutorial â€“ Data Model:
--------------------------------
Cluster: A Cassandra Cluster is a storage unit for data centers on which the entire data is stored for processing in the Cassandra NoSQL database.

Data center: A set of related nodes are grouped in a data center.

Node: The specific place where the data resides on the cluster is called a node.


Commit log: It is a failsafe method that is deployed by Cassandra in order to take a backup of all data in the Cassandra database by writing it to the commit log.

Memtable: It is a data structure that resides in the memory where Cassandra buffers writes. There will be one active Memtable per table.

SSTable: When Memtables reach their threshold value, they are flushed onto the disk, and they become immutable SSTables.

Bloom filter: The bloom filter is an algorithm that lets you test whether an element is a member of a set in a swift manner. These bloom filters are accessed after each query.
